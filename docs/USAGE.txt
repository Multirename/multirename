## Usage of Multirename

### Forword

+ At the moment only the filename without the file extension will be handled.

+ Internally always the long options will be used. If you use short options, no
problem, but if you want to see the saved configuration the long options will be
shown and used. Also as remark if you want to use the Mumsys_Multirename class
in php context e.g: in your own scripts this is the way.

For the moment (may be for all the time):

+ A logger tracks all actions to a log file (default in `multirename/tmp/` (max.
3MB) if you  dont change it). This make sence in the current state of the
program to find and debug open or not detected bugs for you, me....

+ Configurations can be saved but only one config per path at the moment. (i'm
still thinking about to extend it or not! It makes things complicated and a GUI
would be the next step to handle thouse parts. Maybe someone likes do it?


### Hints

+ When executing the program you may think something went wrong because it seems
that the programm hangs: Probably you have enabled the --keepcopy flag and there
is a hugh file which will be copied and not renamed! Dont break operations! This
can loose informations for a recovery or undo action. Have look at the log file
first (tail -f multirename/tmp/multirename.$USER.log) befor stop the process.

### Usage options (--help)

    --test|-t
        Flag: test before execute

    --path|-p <yourValue/s>
        Path to scann for files (tailing slash is important!) * Required

    --fileextensions|-e <yourValue/s>
        Semicolon separated list of file extensions to scan for eg.
        "avi;AVI;mpg;MPG" or "*" (with quotes) for all files * Required

    --substitutions|-s <yourValue/s>
        Semicolon separated list with key value pairs for substitution eg:
        --substitutions ä=ae;ö=oe;ß=ss; =_;'regex:/^(\d{5})$/i=x_\$1'... .As
        simple feature you can use %path1%...%pathN% parameters to substitute
        path informations in substitution values the file belongs to. For more
        information see --sub-paths but only use --sub-paths if you really need
        it. It can became strange side effects when enabling it. * Required

    --sub-paths
        Flag; Enable substitution using paths. Feature for the substitution:
        Breadcrumbs of the --path can be found/ substituted with %path1% -
        %pathN% in reverse. If you want to rename files and want to add the
        folder the file belongs to you can use %path1%. One folder above is
        %path2% and so on until the given root in --path. Example:
        /var/files/records => %path1% = records, %path2% = files, %path3% = var;
        With this option you can also replace %pathN% in keys or values and also
        in regular expressionsUse the --test flag and test and check the results
        carefully! WARNING: Enabling this feature can change the behavior of
        existing substitutions  in your cmd line!

    --find|-f <yourValue/s>
        Find files. Semicolon seperated list of search keywords or regular
        expressions (starting with "regex:"). The list will be handled in OR
        conditons.The keyword checks for matches in any string of the file
        location (path and filename). Optional

    --exclude <yourValue/s>
        Exclude files. Semicolon seperated list of search keywords or regular
        expressions (starting with "regex:"). The list will be handled in OR
        conditons.The keyword will be checked for matches in any string of the
        file location (path and filename). Exclude will also ignore matches from
        the --find option; Optional

    --recursive|-r
        Flag, if set read all files under each directory starting from --path
        recursively

    --keepcopy
        Flag. If set keep all existing files

    --hidden
        Include hidden files (dot files)

    --link <yourValue/s>
        Don't rename, create symlinks or hardlinks, relativ or absolut to target
        (Values: soft|hard[:rel|abs]). If the second parameter is not given
        relativ links will be created

    --linkway <yourValue/s>
        Optional for --link: Type of the link to be created: Relative or absolut
        ("rel"|"abs"), default: "rel". This will be used internally if you use
        e.g: --link soft:rel or --link soft:abs the linkway will be extracted
        from that line. Otherwise use --link soft --linkway rel|abs

    --history
        Flag; If set this will track the current action in a history file e.g.
        for a later undo.

    --history-size <yourValue/s>
        Integer; Number of history entrys if --history is enabled; Default: 10.
        To be set with --save-config and to be used automatically with
        --from-config. Note: If you run on much more than hundreds of files you
        may set the memory limit to a higher value and/or reduce this number to
        1. This feature may consume much memory. Using the --test mode with
        loglevel 6 or higher will give you informations about the memory usage.

    --batch
        Flag; Not implemented yet. Run the job recusiv from given --path as
        start directory and start renaming. If a new configuration in the sub
        directories exists it trys to load the configuration for batch-mode and
        execute it. This enables --recursiv and --history

    --plugins
        Not implemented yet. Semicolon separated list of plugins to include.
        Plugins to assist youfor the renaming. Eg.: You have a text file
        including the new name of the file, or parts of it: The pluging gets the
        content and uses it befor or after the other rules take affect! Example:
        --plugins 'GetTheTitleFromVDRsInfoFile:before;CutAdvertising:after'

    --undo
        Flag; Revers/ undo the last action

    --from-config <yourValue/s>

    --save-config
        Flag; Saves the configuration to the --path of the config which adds a
        new folder ".multirename" for later use with --from-config

    --del-config
        Flag; Deletes the config from given --path

    --show-config
        Flag; Shows the config parameters from a saved config to check or
        rebuild it. Use it with --from-config=/some/path/movies/ --show-config
        (see --save-config)

    --loglevel|--ll <yourValue/s>
        Logging level for the output of messages (0=Emerg ... 7=verbose/debug).
        For testing use 6 or 7; For cronjob etc. do not use lower than 5 to get
        important messages

    --stats
        Print some stats after execution

    --version|-v
        Flag; Return version information
