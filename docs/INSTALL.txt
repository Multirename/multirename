## Downloads

Getting the source you have serveral options:
[Download page for releases](https://github.com/flobee/multirename/releases)
https://github.com/flobee/multirename/releases


## Pre-Install
(*nix based systems)

Install php and required modules:

    # and the suggested packages
    apt-get install php5-cli php5-json

To be mentiond: The default shell:
For multirename it self: php is the shell. For shell scripts: /bin/dash was the 
default shell. Some output may be different when using bash. ash seems to be 
fine also.


## Windows

Please use cygwin (http://cygwin.com). Native support will be in the future)


### Quick install 
(Unix/Linux/BSD based systems)

    (copy & past)
    cd /tmp
    wget https://github.com/flobee/multirename/blob/testing/deploy/multirename\
    -##VERSIONSTRING##.tgz?raw=true -O multirename-##VERSIONSTRING##.tgz
    tar -xf multirename-##VERSIONSTRING##.tgz
    chmod +x multirename.phar
    mv multirename.phar /usr/local/bin/multirename
    multirename --help

    
## Developer install
    
Checkout the code and required library:

    git clone https://github.com/flobee/multirename.git
    cd multirename/
    # checkout and update master|testing|unstable
    sh ./helper/gitupdate.sh [optional: master|testing|unstable]
    

The files you will call directly (if not already done):

    chmod +x <file>


## The program comes in two flavors

    1) Standard php usage (the src directory must be/stay intact):

    2) Single file usage (using a *.jar like file which is called "phar")
        (you can delete all other files. Everything is in that file)


    1. Possible options to run:

    1.1: php /path/where/src/multirename.php [--help|options]
    1.2: /path/where/src/multirename [--help|options]

    1.3: Make it global available:
        Became root
        ln -s /path/where/src/multirename /usr/local/bin/
        multirename [--help|options]


    2. For users who just want to use the program. Possible options:

    2.1: /path/where/build/multirename.phar [--help|options]

    2.2: Make it global available:
        copy or move /path/where/build/multirename.phar to /usr/local/bin/multirename
        multirename [--help|options]

        Or (but build directory must be intact):
        ln -s /path/where/build/multirename.phar /usr/local/bin/multirename
        multirename [--help|options]



# Build
(build/make.php)


This is not a typical make but for most of you probably an interesting corner.

This shows you how to create your own multirename.phar file or building a new 
release.


## Build options

1. php make.php install
2. php make.php clean
3. php make.php deploy


### 1.: php make.php install:

You decided to use the bundled version (all files and required libraries in
one file) for an easy usage. Use the file multirename.phar, thats all!

If you want to build it by yourself, run: php make.php install

Note: This requires php >= 5.4 and changes in your php.ini:
Changes in the php.ini for the cli only is ok. The php.ini for web/ live
enviroment: STOP: NOT OK!

    e.g.: /etc/php5/cli/php.ini; Change:
    ";phar.readonly = On" to
    "phar.readonly = 0" (drop semicolon, On to 0 (Off))

Then you are able to create your own multirename.phar file whichs bundles
all nessasary files for the program to one file (Like *.jar files) and
you can use that file which is more easy to handle.

If you dont see any errors, the "multirename.phar" were created.
Please check if its working by running:

    php multirename.phar --help

The first line must show: "[INFO] Usage:"

The performance of this bundle is nearly the same than using the standard
sources for a php application (some people say it boost the performance...)
Well :-) less disk IO can make sence.

On upgrades only "multirename.phar" needs to be updated. Checkout the deploy/
directory where i will add final versions.


### 2.: php make.php clean:

Drops files created within the make script


### 3.: php make.php deploy

Task for a new release of multirename or just updating the documentation. For 
more please have a look in the [contributions section](#contributions) or at the
[docs/](/flobee/multirename/tree/master/docs/CONTRIBUTE.txt)
