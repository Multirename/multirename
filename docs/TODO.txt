# TODOs for Multirename

## Reported issues

- [00%] #2 global substitutions as prefix or suffix to current substitutions?

- [40%] #4 Extend the history
            1. prepare for multiple undo's (collecting) [100%]
            2. Implement feature for multiple undo's
                - drop used history item? yes! implemented "history-size"[100%]
                - select a process to undo
            3. detection of already removed files..
            what to do then? how to report? if target file exists (keep copy or
            replace? in batch?) ?


## General

- [34%] cleanup code: eg: substitution in a new methode, testmode in a new 
        methode eg (tbc.): actionTest(), actionRename()

- [50%] improve the (test)output. limit messages e.g.: 'DONE'

## history

- [10%] extend history, multiple undo's, detection of already removed files.. 
      what to do then? how to report? if target file exists (keep copy or 
      replace? in batch?) ?

## config and presets

- [ ] Config files centalized or where it happens?
      where it happens:
      - bad 
          on multi-user systems: file permission problems (eg. shared folders)
          no config share (can be help-/useful eg in: /var/)
      - good 
          to look directly in the config file where the action belongs to

- [30%] using presets? individual names for a config incl. date informations

- [30%] extend config, usage of different config setups/presets
      --> presets in the local storage with --preset option? yes, sounds good!
      --preset only if not the default: "_" value

- [00%] rename list of given (existing|nonexisting?) files or output shell args 
        or a list of from->to?

## new features

- [00%] rename list of given files in a text file

- [00%] scan for fileextensions given by a regex? without extension?

- [00%] extend rename function to substitute the hole filename including
        extension

- [00%] rename directories

- [00%] extend rename function to apply filter functions (befor and after) like:
        UPPER, lower, ucfirst, ucword

 -[00%] @todo windows? cygwin: yes 
        nativ support with c:\php.exe multirename.php ?
        how to link/symlink, hidden files?
