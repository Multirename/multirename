# TODOs for Multirename

#2 global substitutions as prefix or suffix to current substitutions?


# New Features

## this is the creative zone

@todo Config files centalized or where it happens?
where it happens:
     - bad 
         on multi-user systems: file permission problems (eg. shared folders)
         no config share (can be help-/useful eg in: /var/)
     - good 
         to look directly in the config file where the action belongs to
@todo using presets? individual names for a config incl. date informations
@todo extend config, usage of different config setups/presets
--> presets in the local storage with --preset option? yes, sounds good!

@todo rename list of given (existing|nonexisting?) files
    output shell args or a list of from->to?

@todo rename list of given files in a text file

@todo scan for fileextensions given by a regex? without extension?

@todo extend history, multiple undo's, detection of already removed files.. 
    what to do then? how to report? if target file exists (keep copy or replace? in batch?) ?

@todo extend rename function to substitute the hole filename including extension


@todo windows? cygwin: yes must work. most of the lib was created on it in that 
    time :-) but nativ support with c:\php.exe multirename.php ?
    how to link/symlink, how to hidden files

@todo improve the (test)output. limit messages e.g.: 'DONE'
