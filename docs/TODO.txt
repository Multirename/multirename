# TODOs for Multirename

## Reported issues
- [ ] #2 global substitutions as prefix or suffix to current substitutions?


# New Features

## this is the creative zone

- [ ] Config files centalized or where it happens?
      where it happens:
      - bad 
          on multi-user systems: file permission problems (eg. shared folders)
          no config share (can be help-/useful eg in: /var/)
      - good 
          to look directly in the config file where the action belongs to
- [ ] using presets? individual names for a config incl. date informations
- [ ] extend config, usage of different config setups/presets
      --> presets in the local storage with --preset option? yes, sounds good!

- [ ] rename list of given (existing|nonexisting?) files or output shell args 
      or a list of from->to?

- [ ] rename list of given files in a text file

- [ ] scan for fileextensions given by a regex? without extension?

- [ ] extend history, multiple undo's, detection of already removed files.. 
      what to do then? how to report? if target file exists (keep copy or 
      replace? in batch?) ?

- [ ] extend rename function to substitute the hole filename including extension


@todo windows? cygwin: yes must work. most of the lib was created on it in that 
    time :-) but nativ support with c:\php.exe multirename.php ?
    how to link/symlink, how to hidden files

- [ ] improve the (test)output. limit messages e.g.: 'DONE'

- [ ] cleanup code: eg: substitution in a new methode, testmode in a new methode 
      eg: actionTest(), actionRename()
