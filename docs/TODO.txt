# TODOs for Multirename

## Reported issues

- [00%] #2 global substitutions as prefix or suffix to current substitutions?

- [30%] #4 Extend the history
            1. prepare for multiple undo's (collecting) [100%]
            2. Implement feature for multiple undo's
                - drop used history item? yes! implemented "history-size"[100%]
                - select a process to undo
            3. detection of already removed files..
            what to do then? how to report? if target file exists (keep copy or
            replace? in batch?) ?

- [x] #3 Incomplete tests for _getRelevantFiles() when run the program with or
         without the --find option -> in version 1.3.0
- [x] #5 Like the --find option we need an --exclude option to hide from current
         substitution!  -> in version 1.3.1


# New Features

## this is the creative zone

- [ ] Config files centalized or where it happens?
      where it happens:
      - bad 
          on multi-user systems: file permission problems (eg. shared folders)
          no config share (can be help-/useful eg in: /var/)
      - good 
          to look directly in the config file where the action belongs to
- [ ] using presets? individual names for a config incl. date informations
- [ ] extend config, usage of different config setups/presets
      --> presets in the local storage with --preset option? yes, sounds good!

- [ ] rename list of given (existing|nonexisting?) files or output shell args 
      or a list of from->to?

- [ ] rename list of given files in a text file

- [ ] scan for fileextensions given by a regex? without extension?

- [ ] extend rename function to substitute the hole filename including extension

- [ ] extend rename function to apply filter functions (befor and after) like:
      UPPER, lower, ucfirst, ucword


@todo windows? cygwin: yes must work. most of the lib was created on it in that 
    time :-) but nativ support with c:\php.exe multirename.php ?
    how to link/symlink, how to hidden files

- [ ] improve the (test)output. limit messages e.g.: 'DONE'

- [33%] cleanup code: eg: substitution in a new methode, testmode in a new methode 
      eg: actionTest(), actionRename()
