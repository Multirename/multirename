# Multirename 

## multirename - A shell program written in PHP

### Version ##VERSIONSTRING##

This program is made to use as shell program and also for batch processing. 
This means: If you have tonns of files to be renamed or have always new files 
which must be renamed: This program is made for you! I use it only in cronjobs. 


Hello! Welcome to my program. I hope you will enjoy it!

Happy renaming!
