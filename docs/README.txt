# Multirename 

## multirename - A shell program written in PHP

### Version 2.4.6

This program is made to use as shell program and also for batch processing. 
This means: If you have tonns of files to be renamed or have always new files 
which must be renamed: This program is made for you! I use it only in cronjobs
but its also possible for web applications and file renaming tasks.


Hello! Welcome to my program. I hope you will enjoy it!

Happy renaming! :-)


Notice: Auto generated file. All documentation was bundled in the README.md.
For a single text files have a look at the [/docs](/docs))
Versions: The documentation at the wiki belongs to the stable branch / latest
stable release. This documentation belongs to the branch you switch to. The
latest version you will find at the "unstable" branch.
And: The wiki takes extra work to care about. Dont trust if you see an older
version. Probably i forgot to update it.



### Warning

Since version 1.4.4 the repository gets broken and is now set new. The good: Its
working now/again. The bad: Pull on existing clones/ forks: I dont know how
to fix it, yet. Even tags are currently lost and result in no existing commits.
Bindings to the underlaying library are also broken (some, some are not).

Replace it!

The old bundled versions (1.* - 1.4*, php<8) use the [binary
versions](https://github.com/Multirename/bin/tree/master/version1).

I'm still try to fix some things. Some documentation about what was happening
can be reviewed in /docs.
