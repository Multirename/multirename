# History

Multirename is made for users which have not that detailed knowlege using the
shell. Also me :-) but i know php and find my solution to help myself for a
solution to rename files like i need it. Multirename was born.
Nothing new! And maybe already done anywhere in any rename program.
Maybe some of my ideas you will find useful or finds a new home ... Hopfully it 
will stay here :-)
The very beginning of this program was in ~2002 and now, again because of music
and video files the vdr (video disk recording) project gave me the idea to
finish this program including some features i was looking for.
