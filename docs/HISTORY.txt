# History

Multirename is made for users which have not that detailed knowlege using the
shell. Also me :-) but i know php and find my solution to help myself for a
solution to rename files like i need it. Multirename was born.
Nothing new! And maybe already done anywhere in any rename program.

Maybe some of my ideas you will find useful or finds a new home ... Hopfully it 
will stay :-)
The very beginning of this program was in ~2002 and now, again because of music
and video files the vdr (video disk recording) project gave me the idea to
finish this program including some features i was looking for.


## Important version history informations

### VERSION > 1.4.6 goes 2.4.6

    Requires PHP >= 8

    Because of the underlaying library.


### VERSION < 1.4.6

    Most versions not published.

    Nearly all versions should work with php5.6...php8.3


### VERSION < 1.3.3 
If you are updating to a newer version of multirename and your version is lower 
than version 1.3.3 you need to update your existing configs. Beginning with 
Version 2.0.0 the migration will be removed.
When executing some renaming please update the configs to the new structure by 
using the --save-config flag. 
e.g: multirename --from-config /path --save-config
