# Contributions

## Contributors are welcome!

Checkout a branch of master|testing|unstable including updates and switching
to one of it and including the externals with updates, use the helper script:

    ./helper/gitupdate.sh [branchname]

I decide to use staging areas to keep the "master" clean of bugs as good as 
possible and for maximum of stability.

Staging areas are "unstable" -> "testing" -> "master"

"master" should be always the latest stable release! (Incl. Hotfixes)

All new code/ development shoud go to "unstable". 
Also, if needed, to the externals which having also these staging areas.

If you would like to add features or push some improvements: The unstable branch 
is basicly the entry point and the latest code base.
Checkout the "unstable" branch create a new branch for your part to start in.
    
    git clone https://github.com/flobee/multirename.git
    cd multirename
    ./helper/gitupdate.sh unstable
    git checkout -b yourNewBranch

Note: You may also create own branches for the existing externals

    cd external/<name>
    git checkout -b yourNewBranch

If tests exists and the function of fixed bugs, new features is verified it will
be merged to "testing" (collecting the updates, versions, features)... for the 
next release candidate or sub releases.

Hotfixes will go to extra branches and will be merged directly to the "master".

When merging branches take a look into .gitmodules of _each_ branch and verify
that the branches still map to the branch name of the master project.
E.g.: The branch "testing" of the project maps to the "testing" branch of the
submodules eg. the library, and so on. 
For this reason you may use the helper script more often and follow this 
workflow: 

    # checkout given branch of the main project
    # init, updates and pulls the submodules for the given branch
    ./helper/gitupdate.sh [unstable|testing|master]

    # After a merge, e.g.:
    ./helper/gitupdate.sh testing
    git merge unstable
    # you need to check if it maps to testing and not unstable branches
    ls -al .gitmodules # which should link to the testing file


## Deployment

The build/make.php file will help to create files for the deployment e.g. if you 
would like to create new readme.md/wiki entrys or to create a release. All text 
files in the docs/ are involved. If you modify them there using markdown syntax 
the deployment and the creation with new documentation will be generated.

    # Will generate .md files for the wiki and the summary file /README.md
    php make.php deploy

    # will also create a new tar file with the release version in /deploy (the
    # version string must match to the current version of the multirename class)
    php make.php deploy '1.0.0-RC1'

Please use `make.php clean` after a deploy to not commit those files to the 
repository.

When commiting new stuff you should first commit the externals changes and at 
least the project version. The external commit ID should map to the commit ID of
the project when other people will check it out. I know this is not that handy 
but i have no other/better idea at the moment to handle it.
